It’s also a popular day for people to get engaged or married. In recent years, Valentine’s Day has also become a day for friends and family members to show their love and appreciation for each other.

        <p>  A bell sounds good when you ring it 
A song sounds so good when you sing it 
Love feels good when you give it back 
Love feels so good when there is no lack 
Give love and spread love all around 
There is a magic in your love that surrounds,I may not be able to hold you in my arms or gaze into your eyes, but the love I have for you is just as strong as ever. Even though we’re apart, my heart is always with you. Every day, I cherish the memories we’ve made and look forward to the future we’ll share. Happy Valentine’s Day to the one I love. 
Happy Valentine's Day to you!
